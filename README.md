# Homework for Genesis Front-end school is to create a TikTok-like app

[Demo](https://zhannapopenko.github.io/tik-tuk/)

The app has a home page with videos of different users. The app also has a user profile, which you can go to from the main page and see more information about the user and watch his video.

### I have built this app using:

- React JS
- Material-UI
- Axios
- RapidAPI

## To start this app:

### `npm i`

This will install the packages you need.
